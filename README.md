# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is not just a cost problem — it directly impacts growth and customer lifetime value.  
This project analyzes telecom customer data to understand why customers leave and to identify actions that improve retention.  

The work included:
- Data profiling & cleaning (fixing wrong churn labels, filling missing churn reasons).  
- Building an interactive dashboard in Power BI.  
- Extracting insights about customer usage, contracts, payments, and demographics.

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Usage Behavior**  
  - Churned customers make fewer calls and spend fewer minutes.  
  - They also use more mobile data, and many churners are on unlimited plans.  

- **Contract Type & Duration**  
  - Month-to-Month contracts show the highest churn.  
  - Annual contracts help reduce churn.  

- **Payment Method**  
  - Credit card users are more stable.  
  - Customers using direct debit or paper checks churn more.  

- **Customer Service**  
  - Higher churn among customers who contacted support frequently.  

- **Services**  
  - Many churned customers made international calls without having an international plan.  

- **Geography**  
  - States like Ohio, Maryland, and California show higher churn.  
  - States like New York, Minnesota, and Wisconsin show stronger retention.  

- **Churn Reasons**  
  - The main drivers are *perceived poor value*, unexpected charges (especially international), and negative service experiences.

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced
- Wrong labels in churn data and missing churn categories required fixing before analysis.  
- The dataset was imbalanced, with far fewer churners than non-churners.  
- Choosing the most relevant variables was difficult with so many available features.  
- Some churn patterns were complex (e.g., unlimited plan dissatisfaction, or international usage without a plan).  
- The dashboard needed multiple iterations to keep insights clear and easy to understand.

## 🛠️ Recommendations
1. **Encourage secure payments** → Promote credit card or online payments.  
2. **Contract incentives** → Offer discounts and rewards for annual contracts; give flexible perks to month-to-month customers.  
3. **Targeted regional actions** → Provide stronger support and special offers in high-churn states.  
4. **International usage** → Offer tailored international plans and discounts.  
5. **Data consumption** → Improve unlimited plans, send usage alerts, and add loyalty benefits.  
6. **Customer support** → Contact high-risk customers early, solve issues fast, and reward loyal ones.  
7. **Predictive analysis** → Use analytics/AI to detect who might churn and act before they leave.

## ✅ Conclusion
By addressing issues in contracts, payments, customer service, and plan value, telecom providers can reduce churn significantly.  
Retention is not only about saving costs — it builds stronger customer relationships and drives long-term growth.
